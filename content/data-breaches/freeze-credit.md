A credit freeze is one of the most effective tools available for preventing identity theft after a [data breach](/data-breaches/). When your Social Security number, date of birth, or other identity information is exposed, the primary risk is that someone will use that information to open new credit accounts in your name -- credit cards, loans, mortgages, or lines of credit you never authorized. A credit freeze blocks this by preventing credit bureaus from releasing your credit report to potential new creditors. No credit report access means no new account approvals.

This guide walks you through the process of placing credit freezes at all three major bureaus, explains the difference between freezes and fraud alerts, and addresses the most common concerns about how freezes affect your daily life.

## What a Credit Freeze Does

A credit freeze (also called a security freeze) restricts access to your credit report at each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. When a freeze is in place:

- **New credit applications are blocked**: Any creditor who runs a credit check as part of a new account application will be unable to access your report, and the application will typically be denied.
- **Existing accounts are unaffected**: Your current credit cards, loans, and mortgages continue to function normally. A freeze does not close or restrict existing accounts.
- **Your credit score is unaffected**: A freeze does not appear on your credit report and has no impact on your credit score.
- **Soft inquiries still work**: Pre-approved credit offers, employment background checks (where permitted), and your own credit checks are not blocked.

The freeze remains in place until you lift it, either temporarily (for a specific creditor or time window) or permanently.

## Why You Should Freeze After a Breach

If a breach has exposed your Social Security number, you should freeze your credit immediately. Here is why:

### Identity Thieves Move Fast

Stolen identity data is often sold or used within days of a breach. The gap between the breach occurring, the company discovering it, and you being notified can be weeks or months. By the time you receive a [breach notification letter](/data-breaches/notification-letters/), your information may already be in circulation on dark web marketplaces. A freeze is your proactive defense during this window.

### Credit Monitoring Is Reactive, Not Preventive

Many breach notifications include an offer of free credit monitoring. While monitoring is useful -- it alerts you when suspicious activity occurs on your credit report -- it does not prevent the activity. A credit freeze is preventive. It stops unauthorized accounts from being opened in the first place.

### The Cost Is Zero

Since 2018, credit freezes and unfreezes are free for all consumers in the United States. There is no financial reason not to freeze.

## Step-by-Step: Freezing Your Credit

You must place a freeze at each bureau individually. Each bureau has its own process and its own PIN or password for managing the freeze.

### Equifax

**Online**: Visit the Equifax freeze page at equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/

**By phone**: Call 1-888-298-0045

**Process**:
1. Create an Equifax account (or log in to an existing one)
2. Navigate to "Place a Security Freeze"
3. Verify your identity (you will be asked personal information questions)
4. Confirm the freeze
5. Save your PIN or confirmation number -- you will need it to lift the freeze later

### Experian

**Online**: Visit experian.com/freeze

**By phone**: Call 1-888-397-3742

**Process**:
1. Create an Experian account (or log in)
2. Select "Security Freeze"
3. Verify your identity
4. Confirm the freeze
5. Save your PIN -- Experian may issue a 10-digit PIN

### TransUnion

**Online**: Visit transunion.com/credit-freeze

**By phone**: Call 1-888-909-8872

**Process**:
1. Create a TransUnion account (or log in)
2. Navigate to "Credit Freeze"
3. Verify your identity
4. Confirm the freeze
5. Save your PIN or password

### Important: Do All Three

You must freeze at all three bureaus. Creditors may check any one of the three (or multiple), and a freeze at only one or two leaves gaps. It takes about 10-15 minutes per bureau, so budget 30-45 minutes for the full process.

### Store Your PINs Securely

You will need your PIN or password to lift or temporarily thaw each freeze. Store these in your [password manager](/password-managers/). If you use a KeePass-compatible manager like PanicVault, your freeze PINs are protected by AES-256 encryption in your local database file -- not stored on a vendor's cloud server where they could be exposed in a [password manager breach](/data-breaches/password-manager-breached/).

### Consider NCTUE

The National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange (NCTUE) is a lesser-known credit agency used by telecom and utility companies. Freezing with NCTUE prevents identity thieves from opening phone, cable, or utility accounts in your name. Contact NCTUE at 1-866-349-5355.

### ChexSystems

ChexSystems is a consumer reporting agency used by banks for checking account applications. Placing a security alert or freeze with ChexSystems (1-800-428-9623) can help prevent fraudulent bank accounts from being opened in your name.

## Credit Freeze vs. Fraud Alert

These are often confused, but they serve different purposes.

### Fraud Alert

A fraud alert tells creditors to take extra steps to verify your identity before opening new accounts. It does not block access to your credit report -- it just flags it.

- **Initial fraud alert**: Lasts one year. You only need to contact one bureau; they notify the other two.
- **Extended fraud alert**: Lasts seven years. Requires an Identity Theft Report filed with the FTC.
- **Active duty alert**: For military members on active duty. Lasts one year.

**Limitations**: Creditors are supposed to verify your identity when they see a fraud alert, but the requirement is not absolute. A determined or careless creditor might still approve a fraudulent application.

### Credit Freeze

A credit freeze blocks access to your credit report entirely for new applications. It is stronger than a fraud alert.

- You must contact each bureau individually.
- Remains in place until you lift it.
- You control when and for whom it is lifted.

**Recommendation**: If a breach exposed your SSN or other government IDs, place a credit freeze (not just a fraud alert). If a freeze is not practical for your situation, a fraud alert is better than nothing.

## Living with a Credit Freeze

The most common concern about credit freezes is inconvenience. In practice, the impact on daily life is minimal.

### Things That Work Normally with a Freeze

- Using your existing credit cards
- Making payments on existing loans and mortgages
- Checking your own credit score
- Banking and checking accounts (in most cases)
- Employment background checks
- Insurance applications (in most states)

### Things That Require a Temporary Thaw

- Applying for a new credit card
- Applying for a mortgage or auto loan
- Renting an apartment (if the landlord runs a credit check)
- Opening a new cell phone plan
- Setting up new utility services (in some cases)

### How to Temporarily Lift a Freeze

When you need to apply for new credit:

1. Ask the creditor which bureau(s) they check. Most use only one.
2. Log in to that bureau's website.
3. Request a temporary lift for a specific date range (usually 1-3 days is sufficient) or for a specific creditor.
4. The lift takes effect within minutes for online requests.
5. The freeze automatically re-engages after the specified period or once the creditor has completed their check.

Many people who freeze their credit report that temporary lifts are easy and add only a few minutes to the process of applying for new credit. The small inconvenience is vastly outweighed by the protection.

## Freezing Credit for Children

Children are attractive targets for identity theft because the fraud may go undetected for years -- until the child applies for their first credit account. All three major bureaus allow you to place a freeze on a minor's credit report. This is especially important if a breach exposed family data.

The process requires additional documentation:
- Proof of your identity (government-issued ID)
- Proof of the child's identity (birth certificate)
- Proof of your authority (as parent or guardian)

## After the Freeze: Ongoing Vigilance

A credit freeze is a critical defense, but it is not comprehensive. It does not protect against:

- Fraud on existing accounts (monitor your statements)
- Tax identity theft (file your returns early)
- Medical identity theft (review your Explanation of Benefits)
- [Credential stuffing](/data-breaches/credential-stuffing/) and account takeover (use unique passwords and [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/))

Combine your credit freeze with ongoing [identity theft monitoring](/data-breaches/monitoring-alerts/), regular credit report reviews (pull free reports at AnnualCreditReport.com), and the breach response practices outlined in our guide to [what to do after a data breach](/data-breaches/what-to-do-after-breach/).

If identity theft does occur despite your freeze, the [identity theft recovery guide](/data-breaches/identity-theft-recovery/) provides a step-by-step process for resolving it, including realistic [recovery timelines](/data-breaches/recovery-timeline/).
