A password policy is one of those things every business knows it should have and few small businesses actually create. The obstacle is usually the same: the existing templates online are designed for enterprises with dedicated IT departments, running to dozens of pages filled with jargon about Active Directory group policies and LDAP authentication requirements. A five-person design agency does not need that. It needs a clear, concise document that everyone will read and follow. This guide is part of our [Password Management for Business & Freelancers](/business/) series, and it provides a practical template you can adapt to your business in an afternoon.

## Why Bother With a Written Policy

You might wonder whether a formal policy is necessary when your team is three people who sit in the same room. It is, for three reasons.

**Clarity eliminates assumptions.** Without a written policy, each team member operates based on their own assumptions about password practices. One person thinks a 10-character password is fine. Another reuses passwords because they cannot remember unique ones. A third shares passwords via text message because it is convenient. A policy aligns everyone on the same practices.

**Accountability requires documentation.** If a breach occurs and you need to demonstrate that your business took reasonable security precautions, a written policy is evidence of that effort. In [compliance contexts](/business/compliance/), regulators and auditors specifically look for documented policies.

**Onboarding becomes consistent.** When a new team member joins, you hand them the policy. They know exactly what is expected. No ambiguity, no need to absorb the culture through osmosis.

## The Small Business Password Policy Template

What follows is a complete, usable password policy template. It is designed for businesses with 2 to 20 people. Adapt the specifics to your context, but keep the structure -- it covers the essentials without unnecessary complexity.

---

### Section 1: Password Requirements

**1.1 All passwords must be generated by an approved password manager.**

We use PanicVault (or specify your chosen tool). Every password for every business account must be generated by the password manager's random generator. No human-chosen passwords.

**1.2 Minimum password specifications.**

- Minimum length: 16 characters
- Must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- No dictionary words, names, dates, or predictable patterns
- No password may be reused across accounts

Note: Since all passwords are generated randomly by the password manager, these specifications are met automatically. This section exists for documentation and compliance purposes.

**1.3 Master password requirements.**

Your password manager master password is the exception -- it must be memorized. Requirements:

- Minimum 4-word passphrase (e.g., four random, unrelated words)
- Must be unique -- never used for any other account
- Must not be written down in any unencrypted format

**1.4 Two-factor authentication.**

[Two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) must be enabled on all accounts that support it, using an authenticator app. SMS-based 2FA is acceptable only when no other option is available. Backup codes must be stored in the password manager.

### Section 2: Password Storage

**2.1 Approved storage.**

All business passwords must be stored in the approved password manager. No exceptions.

**2.2 Prohibited storage.**

The following storage methods are explicitly prohibited for business passwords:

- Browser saved passwords / autofill (disable this feature)
- Notes apps, text files, or documents
- Sticky notes, paper, or whiteboards
- Email drafts or sent messages
- Chat messages (Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.)
- Shared spreadsheets or documents
- Memory (relying on memorization means reusing passwords)

**2.3 Database security.**

The password database file must be stored on an encrypted device with full-disk encryption enabled (FileVault on macOS). Cloud sync is permitted through approved services (specify: iCloud Drive, Dropbox, etc.).

### Section 3: Password Sharing

**3.1 Approved sharing methods.**

When credentials need to be shared with team members:

- Shared [KeePass database](/keepass/) files synced through approved cloud storage
- Self-destructing encrypted message services for one-time sharing
- In-person verbal communication for master passwords

See our [small team sharing guide](/business/small-team-sharing/) for detailed procedures.

**3.2 Prohibited sharing methods.**

Passwords must never be shared through:

- Email
- Slack, Teams, Discord, or any chat platform
- Text messages or phone messaging apps
- Shared documents or spreadsheets
- Verbal communication in public spaces

**3.3 Shared account guidelines.**

For accounts that require multiple users to share a single login:

- The credential lives in the shared password database
- One person is designated as the account owner responsible for the credential
- When the credential is changed, it is updated in the shared database immediately
- Shared credentials are rotated when any person with access leaves the team

### Section 4: Credential Lifecycle

**4.1 New accounts.**

When creating a new business account:

1. Generate a password using the password manager
2. Store the credential in the appropriate folder in the vault
3. Enable two-factor authentication if available
4. Store backup/recovery codes in the vault
5. Note the date of creation

**4.2 Password rotation.**

- Credentials for systems handling sensitive data (financial, customer data, health data) are rotated every 90 days
- All other business credentials are rotated annually
- Any credential suspected of compromise is rotated immediately
- Password rotation is tracked in the password manager's notes field

**4.3 Account decommissioning.**

When a business account is no longer needed:

1. Export any necessary data from the service
2. Delete the account from the service (do not just stop using it)
3. Archive or remove the credential from the password manager
4. Document the decommissioning

### Section 5: Team Member Access

**5.1 Onboarding.**

When a new team member joins:

1. Provide them with the approved password manager application
2. Help them create their vault with a strong master password
3. Share relevant team database passwords through approved secure channels
4. Review this password policy with them
5. Document their access level and which shared databases they receive

**5.2 Offboarding.**

When a team member leaves the business:

1. Immediately change the master passwords for all shared databases they had access to
2. Distribute new master passwords to remaining team members
3. Rotate every individual credential the departing member could access
4. Review their personal vault for any business credentials (if possible, with their cooperation)
5. Document the offboarding, including which credentials were rotated
6. Complete the process within 24 hours of the departure

See our [contractor handoffs guide](/business/contractor-handoffs/) for additional procedures when working with external collaborators.

**5.3 Principle of least privilege.**

Team members receive access only to the credentials they need for their role. Access to financial accounts is restricted to the business owner and bookkeeper. Access to development infrastructure is restricted to technical staff. Shared databases are segmented accordingly.

### Section 6: Incident Response

**6.1 Suspected compromise.**

If any team member suspects a credential has been compromised (through a breach notification, suspicious activity, phishing attempt, or any other indicator):

1. Change the affected password immediately
2. Notify the team lead / business owner within one hour
3. Review the affected account for unauthorized activity
4. Identify other accounts that might be affected (did the compromised service store other credentials? Was the same password used elsewhere -- it should not be, but verify)
5. Enable or verify two-factor authentication
6. Document the incident

**6.2 Lost or stolen device.**

If a device containing password database access is lost or stolen:

1. Remotely wipe the device if possible (Find My Mac, Find My iPhone)
2. Change the master password for every database that was accessible on the device
3. Change passwords for accounts that were actively logged in (browser sessions, etc.)
4. Distribute new master passwords to team members
5. Document the incident

**6.3 Emergency access.**

In case the primary business owner is unavailable:

- Emergency access information is stored in [specify: safe deposit box, with attorney, in sealed envelope with designated contact]
- The emergency kit contains the master password and instructions for accessing the primary password database
- The emergency contact is [specify name and relationship]
- The emergency kit is reviewed and updated annually

### Section 7: Policy Maintenance

**7.1 Review schedule.**

This policy is reviewed quarterly by the business owner. Updates are communicated to all team members.

**7.2 Compliance.**

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all team members, contractors, and anyone with access to business credentials.

**7.3 Effective date.**

This policy is effective as of [date] and supersedes all previous password practices.

## Implementing the Policy

A policy is only as good as its implementation. Here is how to roll it out without friction.

### Step 1: Set Up the Tools First

Before announcing the policy, ensure the infrastructure is in place. Install PanicVault or your chosen [password manager](/password-managers/) on every team member's device. Create the shared databases. Set up [cloud sync](/cloud-sync/). Do the technical work first so that when you introduce the policy, compliance is practical.

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Passwords

Help each team member import their browser-saved passwords into the password manager. Walk through the process of [importing browser passwords](/keepass/import-browser-passwords/) and generating new, unique passwords for each account. This is the most time-consuming part of implementation, but it only happens once.

### Step 3: Present the Policy

Walk through the policy with your team. Explain the "why" behind each section. People follow policies they understand the reasoning for far more consistently than policies handed down by fiat. Reference the statistics: 43 percent of cyber attacks target small businesses, 94 percent of passwords are reused, 60 percent of small businesses close within six months of a breach. These numbers make the case compellingly.

### Step 4: Make It Easy to Reference

Store the policy in a location every team member can access -- your shared documentation system, pinned in your team channel, or printed and posted in the office. A policy no one can find is a policy no one follows.

### Step 5: Lead by Example

If the business owner does not follow the policy, no one will. Use the password manager for every login. Share credentials only through approved methods. Rotate passwords on schedule. Your team will mirror your behavior.

## Common Pushback and How to Address It

**"This is too complicated."** The policy looks longer than it is. In daily practice, it amounts to three things: use the password manager for everything, do not share passwords through chat, and tell someone if you think something is compromised. The rest is documentation for edge cases.

**"I can remember my passwords."** You can remember a few passwords, and those few passwords are almost certainly reused across multiple accounts. The policy exists because human memory is fundamentally incompatible with using unique, strong passwords for 50+ accounts.

**"We are too small to be targeted."** Forty-three percent of cyber attacks target small businesses. Automated attacks do not check your revenue before trying to breach your accounts.

**"It slows me down."** After the initial setup (which takes a few hours), a password manager actually speeds up your workflow. Autofill is faster than typing, and you never waste time on password resets.

## Adapting for Your Context

This template is deliberately comprehensive. For a two-person business, some sections may be unnecessary. For a business in a regulated industry, some sections may need expansion. Adapt freely, but keep these sections regardless of size:

- Password requirements (Section 1)
- Approved and prohibited storage (Section 2)
- Incident response basics (Section 6)

Everything else can be scaled to your context. A [freelancer](/business/freelancers/) working solo can skip the team access sections. A business handling health data should expand the rotation and compliance sections in line with [HIPAA requirements](/business/compliance/).

The goal is a living document that reflects how your business actually handles credentials. Review it quarterly, update it when your practices change, and treat it as the foundation of your business's security posture.
