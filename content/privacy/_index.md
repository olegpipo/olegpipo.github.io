## The Short Version

PanicVault does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Period. Your passwords stay on your device and under your control. We have no servers, no accounts, and no way to see your data.

## Data Collection

PanicVault does **not** collect any data whatsoever. Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No crash reports sent to us
- No advertising identifiers
- No cookies or tracking technologies
- No third-party SDKs that collect data

## Your Vault Data

Your password vault is stored as a KeePass (.kdbx) file on your device. This file is encrypted using AES-256 or ChaCha20 encryption and is protected by your master password.

If you choose to enable iCloud Drive or Google Drive sync, your encrypted vault file is synced through **your own** cloud storage account. PanicVault does not operate any servers and never has access to your vault file or its contents.

## Biometric Data

When you enable Face ID or Touch ID unlock, your master password is stored in the Secure Enclave keychain on your device. Biometric data is processed entirely by the operating system and its dedicated hardware. PanicVault never accesses, stores, or transmits biometric data.

## Third-Party Services

PanicVault does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external connections the app may make are:

- **iCloud Drive** (optional) &mdash; for vault sync through your Apple account
- **Google Drive** (optional) &mdash; for vault sync through your Google account

These connections are initiated only by you, go directly to Apple or Google, and are governed by their respective privacy policies.

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect any data, there is nothing to retain. All your data resides exclusively on your devices and in your personal cloud storage accounts.

## Children's Privacy

PanicVault does not collect data from any user, including children under 13. Because no data is collected, no special provisions are required.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this privacy policy, we will update this page with the new effective date. Given that we collect no data, significant changes are unlikely.
