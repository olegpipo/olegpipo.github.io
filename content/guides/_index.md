Managing passwords should not feel like a second job. The average person juggles roughly 250 passwords across personal and business accounts, and research consistently shows that 94% of those credentials are reused or duplicated across services. If that statistic makes you uncomfortable, you are paying attention. The good news is that a [password manager](/password-managers/) eliminates virtually all of the friction, risk, and mental overhead that comes with managing credentials manually.

This guide hub is your starting point for every aspect of password management -- from your very first setup through advanced techniques like emergency access, vault auditing, and two-factor authentication integration. Each tutorial walks you through the process step by step, with specific instructions for PanicVault (a [KeePass-compatible](/keepass/) password manager built for the [Apple ecosystem](/apple/)) alongside general guidance that applies to whichever tool you choose.

## Getting Started

If you have never used a password manager before, or you have been meaning to set one up but keep putting it off, start here. These guides assume zero prior experience and walk you through everything from installation to daily use.

### [How to Set Up a Password Manager for the First Time](/guides/first-time-setup/)

The complete beginner's guide. Covers choosing a password manager, installing it, creating your vault, and adding your first credentials. You will go from "I should really do this" to "this is already saving me time" in about 30 minutes.

### [How to Create a Secure Master Password You'll Remember](/guides/master-password/)

Your master password is the single key to everything in your vault. This guide teaches you how to create one that is both genuinely strong and reliably memorable -- no sticky notes required. Covers passphrase techniques, common mistakes, and how to test your master password's strength.

### [How to Import Passwords from Chrome, Safari, or Firefox](/guides/import-from-browser/)

Your browser has been saving passwords for you, but it is not a real password manager. This guide shows you how to export those saved credentials and import them into your password manager, covering Chrome, Safari, and Firefox step by step. You will not lose a single login in the transition.

## Organizing and Managing Your Vault

Once you have your password manager set up and your existing credentials imported, these guides help you build a system that scales as you add more accounts.

### [How to Organize Your Password Vault](/guides/organize-vault/)

A vault with 250 entries and no structure is almost as frustrating as no vault at all. Learn folder structures, tagging strategies, naming conventions, and search techniques that keep your credentials findable as your vault grows. Includes practical templates for personal and family vaults.

### [How to Generate and Store Strong Passwords](/guides/generate-strong-passwords/)

Stop trying to invent passwords yourself. Your password manager's generator creates truly random credentials that are immune to dictionary attacks and pattern guessing. This guide covers how to configure your generator for different site requirements and how to handle sites with frustrating password rules.

### [How to Store Secure Notes, Credit Cards, and IDs](/guides/store-notes-cards/)

Your password manager is not just for website logins. Learn how to securely store credit card numbers, identity documents, Wi-Fi passwords, software licenses, secure notes, and other sensitive information. Covers the right way to structure these entries so you can find them when you need them.

## Security and Protection

These guides cover the security practices that turn a password manager from a convenience tool into a genuine defense system for your digital life.

### [How to Audit Your Existing Passwords](/guides/audit-passwords/)

You probably have weak, reused, or compromised passwords in your vault right now. This guide walks you through a systematic audit process -- identifying the worst offenders, prioritizing which accounts to fix first, and working through updates without losing your mind. Most people can fix their most critical vulnerabilities in a single evening.

### [How to Set Up 2FA Using Your Password Manager](/guides/setup-2fa/)

[Two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) is the single most effective upgrade you can make to your account security. Many password managers, including PanicVault, can generate TOTP codes directly, eliminating the need for a separate authenticator app. This guide covers setup, backup, and the tradeoffs of storing 2FA codes alongside your passwords.

### [How to Back Up Your Password Vault](/guides/backup-vault/)

Your vault contains the keys to your entire digital life. What happens if your device breaks, gets stolen, or your [cloud sync](/cloud-sync/) has a problem? This guide covers backup strategies -- from simple file copies to encrypted offsite backups -- that protect you against data loss without creating security vulnerabilities.

## Sharing and Family

Password management is not just an individual activity. These guides cover the social side -- sharing credentials safely and helping the people you care about get set up.

### [How to Share Passwords Securely With Family](/guides/share-with-family/)

Sharing a Netflix password via text message is convenient but insecure. Learn how to share credentials with family members properly -- whether through shared vaults, secure sharing features, or carefully managed shared databases. Covers different approaches for different password managers.

### [How to Set Up Emergency Access to Your Vault](/guides/emergency-access/)

What happens to your passwords if you are incapacitated or worse? Emergency access planning is uncomfortable to think about but essential. This guide covers how to give a trusted person the ability to access your vault in an emergency without compromising your day-to-day security.

### [How to Set Up a Password Manager for Your Parents](/guides/setup-for-parents/)

Helping a less tech-savvy family member adopt a password manager requires patience, the right tool, and a simplified setup. This guide provides a specific, tested approach for getting parents and older relatives started -- including which features to enable, which to hide, and how to provide remote support.

## AutoFill and Daily Use

These guides make sure your password manager works smoothly in the situations where you actually need it -- filling in passwords, handling logins, and working across devices.

### [How to Use AutoFill on iPhone/iPad With a Password Manager](/guides/autofill-setup/)

AutoFill is what makes a password manager practical rather than theoretical. This guide covers setting up AutoFill on iOS and iPadOS, configuring your [password manager as the default credential provider](/apple/credential-provider-extensions/), and troubleshooting the most common AutoFill issues. Specific instructions for PanicVault and other popular managers.

### [How to Use a Password Manager on Public Computers](/guides/public-computers/)

Hotel business centers, library computers, airport kiosks -- sometimes you need to log in on a device you do not own or trust. This guide covers safe strategies for accessing your credentials on shared or public computers without exposing your vault, including web access options, temporary credentials, and what to do after you have finished.

## Migration Guides

Already using a password manager but thinking about switching? These step-by-step migration guides make the transition painless.

### [How to Switch From LastPass: Migration Guide](/guides/switch-from-lastpass/)

LastPass's security incidents have prompted many users to look elsewhere. This guide provides a complete walkthrough for exporting your LastPass vault and importing it into PanicVault, KeePassXC, Bitwarden, or 1Password. Covers credential mapping, secure notes, shared folders, and what to do about credentials that did not transfer cleanly.

### [How to Switch From 1Password: Migration Guide](/guides/switch-from-1password/)

Switching from 1Password -- whether because of pricing, data portability concerns, or a desire for a non-subscription model -- is straightforward when you know the right export settings. This guide walks through the 1Password export process and import into KDBX-compatible managers like PanicVault, covering vaults, tags, custom fields, and TOTP secrets.

## Why Use a Password Manager?

If you are reading this page, you likely already know the answer. But in case you need ammunition to convince a skeptical family member or colleague, here is the short version.

### The Problem Is Real

The statistics are sobering. The average person manages approximately 250 passwords -- 168 for personal accounts and 87 for business use. Studies consistently show that 94% of passwords are reused or duplicated across services, and 69% of people report feeling overwhelmed by password management. These are not edge cases. This is the norm.

When a single data breach exposes your email and password combination -- and breaches happen constantly -- every other account that shares those credentials becomes vulnerable. Reusing passwords is the digital equivalent of using the same key for your house, car, office, and bank safety deposit box, then leaving copies of that key at hundreds of businesses and hoping none of them get robbed.

### The Solution Is Straightforward

A password manager generates a unique, strong, random password for every account and remembers them all for you. You memorize one master password. The manager handles the rest -- filling in login forms, generating new credentials, alerting you to breaches, and syncing across your devices.

The result is not just better security. It is less cognitive load. No more "which password did I use for this site?" No more password reset flows. No more compromise between security and convenience. The two align completely.

### Choosing the Right Tool

The [password manager comparison](/compare/) section of this site evaluates the major options across security, usability, price, and data portability. For Apple users specifically, the [best password manager for iPhone](/apple/best-password-manager-iphone/) and [best password manager for Mac](/apple/best-password-manager-mac/) guides provide detailed, platform-specific recommendations.

If data ownership and portability matter to you -- and they should -- the [KeePass ecosystem](/keepass/) offers an open, auditable standard that no single company controls. PanicVault brings that openness to the Apple ecosystem with native integration, [iCloud sync](/cloud-sync/), [Face ID and Touch ID](/apple/face-id-touch-id-setup/) support, and a user experience designed for people who prefer their tools to feel like they belong on their devices.

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide is self-contained -- you can jump directly to the topic you need. However, if you are new to password management, we recommend this order:

1. [Set up your password manager](/guides/first-time-setup/) and create a [strong master password](/guides/master-password/)
2. [Import your existing browser passwords](/guides/import-from-browser/)
3. [Organize your vault](/guides/organize-vault/) while everything is fresh
4. [Audit your passwords](/guides/audit-passwords/) and fix the worst offenders

Every guide includes specific instructions for PanicVault alongside general advice that applies regardless of which tool you use. Where relevant, we link to deeper resources in our [Apple ecosystem](/apple/), [KeePass](/keepass/), [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/), and [cloud sync](/cloud-sync/) sections.

Password management is not about achieving perfect security. It is about making good security the path of least resistance in your daily life. These guides are designed to get you there.
