Children today are digital natives, but that does not make them digital experts. Growing up with technology gives children fluency in using devices, but it does not automatically teach them to recognize [phishing](/phishing/), protect their privacy, or navigate the social complexities of online interaction. As part of your family's [digital privacy and online safety](/digital-privacy/) approach, teaching children to be safe online is one of the most important and ongoing responsibilities of modern parenting.

This guide provides age-appropriate strategies, practical tools, and conversation frameworks for parents. It is not about fear or control -- it is about equipping children with the knowledge and habits they need to navigate digital life safely and confidently.

## The Threat Landscape for Children

Children face several categories of online risk:

### Content Risks

Exposure to age-inappropriate material -- violence, sexual content, extremist content, self-harm promotion. Content filtering helps but is imperfect, and children are naturally curious.

### Contact Risks

Interaction with people who may pose a threat -- online predators, cyberbullies, scammers. Social media, gaming platforms, and messaging apps all create opportunities for contact with strangers.

### Conduct Risks

The child's own behavior online -- cyberbullying others, sharing personal information, creating inappropriate content, participating in risky challenges. Children may not understand the permanence and reach of what they share online.

### Commercial Risks

Targeted advertising, in-app purchases, data collection, and manipulative design patterns that exploit children's developing impulse control. Many apps and games are specifically designed to maximize engagement and spending.

### Privacy Risks

Children often share personal information without understanding the implications -- their school, location, daily routine, family details. This information can be exploited by bad actors or collected by data brokers and advertisers.

## Age-Appropriate Strategies

### Ages 3-6: Foundation Building

At this age, children are primarily using devices under supervision for educational content and entertainment.

**Key principles:**
- All screen time should be supervised or on pre-approved, curated content
- Begin simple conversations about the difference between real life and what they see on screens
- Set clear limits on screen time (the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than one hour of high-quality programming per day for ages 2-5)
- Use parental controls to restrict content and prevent accidental in-app purchases

**Device settings:**
- Enable Guided Access on iPad/iPhone (Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access) to lock the device to a single app
- Use Apple's Screen Time restrictions to limit which apps are available and set time limits
- Enable "Ask to Buy" in Family Sharing so any app installation or purchase requires your approval

### Ages 7-10: Supervised Independence

Children in this age range are increasingly using devices independently for school and entertainment. They may be starting to communicate with friends online.

**Key principles:**
- Start teaching about online privacy -- what information should never be shared (full name, address, school, phone number)
- Explain that not everyone online is who they claim to be
- Review and discuss the content they consume
- Establish rules for online communication (only with people they know in real life)
- Begin using a family password manager to model good security habits

**Practical steps:**
- Set up their device with Screen Time restrictions (app limits, downtime, content restrictions)
- Review their app usage weekly
- Teach them to come to you if something online makes them uncomfortable
- If they play online games with chat features, review the chat settings and consider disabling chat with strangers

### Ages 11-13: Growing Independence

This is the age when social media becomes a pressing issue. Most platforms officially require users to be 13, though enforcement is minimal. This is also when cyberbullying risk increases significantly.

**Key principles:**
- Have frank conversations about cyberbullying -- both as a target and as a participant
- Discuss the permanence of online content (screenshots, caching, forwarding)
- Teach them to recognize [phishing](/phishing/) and scams
- Introduce the concept of digital reputation
- If they use social media, review privacy settings together

**Practical steps:**
- Help them set up accounts with privacy settings configured appropriately (see our [social media security guide](/digital-privacy/secure-social-media/))
- Use a password manager to create strong, unique passwords for their accounts -- this is a natural opportunity to introduce PanicVault or another [password manager](/password-managers/) as a family tool
- Establish rules for what can and cannot be shared online
- Know their usernames and passwords (this is not surveillance -- it is age-appropriate oversight)
- Check in regularly about their online experiences without being invasive

### Ages 14-17: Preparing for Independence

Teenagers need increasing autonomy, but they also face the most sophisticated threats -- social engineering, sextortion, identity theft, and manipulation through social media.

**Key principles:**
- Shift from control to education and trust -- they will be fully independent soon
- Discuss social engineering and manipulation tactics in detail
- Talk about sextortion -- the practice of threatening to share intimate images -- which disproportionately targets teenagers
- Discuss the implications of their digital footprint for college admissions and future employment
- Teach them about [data privacy rights](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/) and why they matter

**Practical steps:**
- Transition to their own password manager that you do not have access to (respecting their growing independence) while ensuring they understand good password practices
- Discuss [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) and help them enable it on their accounts
- Review their social media privacy settings periodically (with their participation, not behind their back)
- Have ongoing conversations about what they encounter online
- Teach them about data brokers and how personal information is collected and sold

## Technical Tools for Parents

### Apple Screen Time

Apple's Screen Time (Settings > Screen Time) provides comprehensive parental controls:

- **Downtime** -- Schedule times when only approved apps and phone calls are available
- **App Limits** -- Set daily time limits for categories of apps (social media, games, entertainment)
- **Communication Limits** -- Control who your child can communicate with during allowed time and downtime
- **Content & Privacy Restrictions** -- Restrict explicit content, prevent certain app installations, limit web content, and control location sharing
- **Always Allowed** -- Designate apps that are always available regardless of downtime or limits

Set a Screen Time passcode that is different from the device passcode so children cannot modify restrictions.

### Apple Family Sharing

Family Sharing allows you to:

- Require approval for app downloads and purchases ("Ask to Buy")
- Share app and media purchases across the family
- Share iCloud storage
- Locate family members' devices
- Share a password group for family-relevant passwords

### Content Filtering

Beyond Apple's built-in restrictions, DNS-based content filters like CleanBrowsing or OpenDNS FamilyShield can be configured at the [router level](/digital-privacy/secure-home-wifi/) to filter content for all devices on your home network. This provides a safety net even for devices without individual parental controls.

### Communication Monitoring

For younger children, some parents choose to monitor communications. If you do this:

- Be transparent about it -- children should know you can see their messages
- Review messages periodically rather than surveilling in real time
- Reduce monitoring as children demonstrate responsibility and maturity
- Recognize that by the teen years, monitoring becomes counterproductive and damaging to trust

## Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying affects a significant percentage of children and can have severe consequences for mental health. The key differences from traditional bullying are:

- **It follows children home** -- There is no escape from bullying that happens on devices the child uses constantly
- **It has an audience** -- Embarrassing content can spread to the entire school or beyond
- **It is persistent** -- Content can be saved, screenshotted, and resurfaced

### If Your Child Is Being Cyberbullied

1. Listen without judgment and take it seriously
2. Document the bullying (screenshots with dates)
3. Block the bully on the platform
4. Report the behavior to the platform
5. Contact the school if the bully is a classmate
6. Do not retaliate or respond to the bully
7. Consider contacting law enforcement if threats are involved
8. Seek professional help if the child shows signs of depression, anxiety, or self-harm

### If Your Child Is Cyberbullying Others

1. Take it seriously -- cyberbullying can have legal consequences
2. Have an honest conversation about empathy and the impact of their actions
3. Implement consequences
4. Understand the context -- is your child being bullied and retaliating? Are they under peer pressure?
5. Monitor their online activity more closely for a period
6. Consider professional guidance

## Teaching Digital Literacy

Beyond specific safety rules, children need a broader framework for navigating digital life.

### Critical Thinking About Online Content

Teach children to ask:
- Who created this content and why?
- Is this source reliable?
- Am I being manipulated (by urgency, emotion, or social pressure)?
- Is this too good to be true?

### Privacy as a Value

Help children understand that privacy is not about having something to hide -- it is about controlling who knows what about you. Draw parallels to physical-world privacy they already understand (closing the bathroom door, not showing their diary to strangers).

### The Permanence of Digital Content

Everything shared online can potentially be saved, screenshotted, and shared further. Before posting anything, encourage the "billboard test": would you be comfortable if this were on a billboard outside your school?

### Recognizing Manipulation

Social media platforms, games, and apps use psychological techniques to maximize engagement -- infinite scrolling, notification urgency, social comparison, fear of missing out. Teaching children to recognize these patterns gives them agency over their attention.

## Family Agreements

Consider creating a family technology agreement that covers:

- Which devices and platforms are allowed at different ages
- Screen time limits for different activities (homework vs. entertainment)
- Rules for online communication and sharing
- What to do if something uncomfortable happens online
- Consequences for violating the agreement
- A commitment to open communication about online experiences

The agreement should be collaborative, especially for older children. Rules that children help create are rules they are more likely to follow.

## When to Seek Help

Some situations require professional intervention:

- Evidence of contact with an online predator (contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at CyberTipline.org or call 1-800-843-5678)
- Sextortion threats (contact the FBI at tips.fbi.gov)
- Severe cyberbullying affecting mental health
- Signs of addiction to devices or specific platforms
- Discovery of illegal content on your child's device
