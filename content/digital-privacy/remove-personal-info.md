Data brokers are companies that collect, aggregate, and sell your personal information -- and most people have no idea how much of their data is available for purchase. Your home address, phone number, email, relatives' names, income estimates, property records, political affiliations, and purchasing habits are all being bought and sold in a multi-billion-dollar industry. As part of your [digital privacy and online safety](/digital-privacy/) strategy, removing your information from these services is one of the most impactful privacy actions you can take.

The bad news: there are hundreds of data brokers, each with its own opt-out process, and they continuously re-acquire data. The good news: the process, while tedious, is straightforward, and recent legislation like the [DELETE Act](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/) is making it easier. This guide walks you through it step by step.

## What Data Brokers Know About You

Before diving into removal, it helps to understand the scope of the problem. Data brokers typically have:

**Identifying information** -- Full name, aliases, date of birth, age, gender

**Contact information** -- Current and past home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses

**Financial indicators** -- Estimated income range, property ownership, estimated net worth, credit score range

**Relationships** -- Names of relatives, roommates, and associates

**Professional information** -- Employer, job title, professional history

**Public records** -- Property records, court records, marriage and divorce records, voter registration

**Online activity** -- Social media profiles, online usernames, purchasing behavior

**Demographic data** -- Education level, ethnicity, religion, political affiliation, hobbies and interests

This information is compiled from public records, commercial databases, social media, loyalty programs, data partnerships, and other sources. A single data broker profile can paint a disturbingly detailed picture of your life.

## Why Removal Matters

### Identity Theft

Data brokers make identity theft easier by providing criminals with the personal details needed to impersonate you -- your mother's maiden name, your previous addresses, your date of birth. These details are commonly used in security questions and identity verification.

### Phishing and Social Engineering

The more an attacker knows about you, the more convincing their [phishing](/phishing/) attempts. A spear-phishing email that references your employer, your neighborhood, or a recent purchase is far more likely to succeed than a generic one.

### Physical Safety

For survivors of domestic violence, stalking victims, or anyone with safety concerns, having their home address publicly available through data brokers is a direct physical threat.

### Spam and Unwanted Contact

Data brokers are a primary source for telemarketing lists, spam email campaigns, and junk mail. Removing your data reduces the volume of unwanted contact.

### General Privacy

Most people are uncomfortable with the idea that anyone with a few dollars can look up their home address, family members, and estimated income. Removing your data is an assertion of your fundamental privacy rights.

## The Major Data Brokers to Target

Start with the biggest and most visible people-search sites. These are the ones most likely to appear in Google results when someone searches your name.

### Tier 1: Highest Priority

These sites are the most commonly used and should be addressed first:

- **Spokeo** (spokeo.com) -- One of the largest people-search sites
- **BeenVerified** (beenverified.com) -- Popular background check service
- **Whitepages** (whitepages.com) -- The digital version of the phone book, but much more comprehensive
- **Intelius** (intelius.com) -- Major data broker with multiple subsidiary sites
- **PeopleFinder** (peoplefinder.com) -- Extensive public records aggregator
- **TruePeopleSearch** (truepeoplesearch.com) -- Free people search with detailed results
- **FastPeopleSearch** (fastpeoplesearch.com) -- Free, widely used

### Tier 2: Important

- **MyLife** (mylife.com) -- Includes "reputation scores"
- **Radaris** (radaris.com) -- Detailed reports
- **USSearch** (ussearch.com) -- Background check service
- **PeopleLooker** (peoplelooker.com) -- Part of the BeenVerified family
- **Instant Checkmate** (instantcheckmate.com) -- Background check service
- **ThatsThem** (thatsthem.com) -- Free people search
- **ZabaSearch** (zabasearch.com) -- Free name and address lookup

### Tier 3: Additional

Dozens more exist, including Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud (formerly Datalogix), Epsilon, CoreLogic, LexisNexis, and many smaller sites. A comprehensive removal effort would address these as well, but the tier 1 and tier 2 sites handle the most visible exposure.

## The Removal Process

### Step 1: Search for Yourself

Start by searching for yourself on each of the major data broker sites. Also search Google for your full name in quotes, optionally combined with your city or state. This helps you identify which brokers have your data and what information is publicly visible.

Take screenshots or notes of what each site shows. This documents your starting point and helps you verify removal later.

### Step 2: Submit Opt-Out Requests

Each data broker has its own opt-out process. Some are simple (fill out a form, click a link). Others are deliberately tedious (requiring you to create an account, submit identification, or mail a physical letter).

Common opt-out methods:

- **Online form** -- The most common. Fill out a form on the broker's website with the information you want removed.
- **Email request** -- Send an email to the broker's privacy or opt-out address with your removal request.
- **Phone call** -- Some brokers require a phone call.
- **Mail** -- A few require a written letter, sometimes notarized.
- **Identity verification** -- Some brokers require you to verify your identity before processing a removal, which may involve providing additional personal information. This creates an uncomfortable paradox but is sometimes necessary.

### Step 3: Follow Up

Many brokers claim removal takes 24-72 hours but may take weeks. Set calendar reminders to check each site 2-4 weeks after submitting your request. If your data is still visible, resubmit the request and escalate if the broker provides an escalation path.

### Step 4: Use the DELETE Act (California Residents)

If you are a California resident, the [DELETE Act](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/) provides a centralized deletion request mechanism. Submit a single request through the California Data Broker Registry, and all registered brokers must process it. This does not replace individual opt-out requests for unregistered brokers but significantly reduces the workload.

### Step 5: Repeat Periodically

Data brokers re-acquire your information over time from public records, commercial partners, and other sources. Plan to repeat the opt-out process every 6-12 months. Mark your calendar.

## Automated Removal Services

Given the tedious nature of manual removal, several services have emerged that automate the process:

- **DeleteMe** -- Submits opt-out requests on your behalf and monitors for re-listing. Subscription-based.
- **Kanary** -- Similar automated removal with monitoring. Includes family plans.
- **Privacy Duck** -- Handles removals manually with human operators.
- **Optery** -- Scans data brokers, submits removal requests, and provides a dashboard for tracking.

These services charge annual fees (typically $100-200 per year) but save significant time. If your time is worth more than the subscription cost, and you find the manual process overwhelming, an automated service is a reasonable investment.

## Preventing Future Data Collection

Removal is important, but reducing the flow of new data to brokers is equally valuable.

### Minimize Your Public Records Footprint

- Register to vote with the minimum required public information
- Consider using a PO box or mail forwarding service instead of your home address for public filings
- Be aware that property records, court filings, and business registrations become public records that brokers scrape

### Limit What You Share Online

- Use privacy settings on [social media](/digital-privacy/secure-social-media/) to limit what is publicly visible
- Do not fill out online quizzes, surveys, or loyalty programs that collect personal data
- Use email aliases (Apple's Hide My Email or SimpleLogin) so your real email is not scattered across hundreds of databases
- Provide minimal information when creating online accounts

### Use a Password Manager With Unique Credentials

Every account you create is a potential data source. When those services are breached -- and with the average US [data breach](/data-breaches/) costing $10.22 million, breaches are frequent -- your credentials and personal data enter the ecosystem. Using unique passwords from a [password manager](/password-managers/) like PanicVault limits the damage of any single breach.

### Opt Out Proactively

When you create new accounts or interact with new services:

- Read the privacy policy (at least the data sharing and opt-out sections)
- Look for opt-out checkboxes during registration
- Opt out of data sharing, marketing, and third-party partnerships
- Exercise your rights under [privacy laws](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/) to request data minimization

## Google Search Results

Even after removing your data from brokers, cached results may appear in Google searches. You can request removal of specific Google search results that contain personal information:

1. Visit Google's "Results About You" tool (available in the Google app or at google.com/supportcontent)
2. Request removal of results that contain your personal contact information
3. Google will review the request and remove qualifying results

This does not remove the data from the source site -- only from Google's search results. But since Google is how most people find this information, it significantly reduces your exposure.

## A Removal Schedule

**Week 1** -- Search for yourself and document what is out there
**Week 2** -- Submit opt-out requests for Tier 1 brokers
**Week 3** -- Submit opt-out requests for Tier 2 brokers
**Week 4** -- Follow up on Tier 1 requests, submit Google search result removal requests
**Month 2** -- Verify removals, resubmit any that were not processed
**Every 6 months** -- Re-check all brokers and resubmit as needed

If this schedule feels overwhelming, start with just the Tier 1 brokers. Removing your data from the six or seven most prominent people-search sites handles the majority of your visible exposure.

## The Bigger Picture

Data brokers are a symptom of a broader system that treats personal data as a commodity. Removing your data is an important act of self-protection, but it is not a permanent solution. The data flows back. New brokers appear. The system itself needs reform.

In the meantime, the best approach is a combination of:

1. **Removal** -- Regularly opt out from the most visible brokers
2. **Prevention** -- Minimize the data you share and the accounts you create
3. **Legal rights** -- Exercise your rights under [privacy laws](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/)
4. **Security** -- Use [strong passwords](/password-security/), [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/), and a [password manager](/password-managers/) to limit the damage when breaches occur
5. **Awareness** -- Understand the landscape and make informed decisions

Your personal information has value -- to you, to advertisers, and to criminals. Taking control of who has access to it is a fundamental exercise in digital self-determination.
