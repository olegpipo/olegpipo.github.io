Travel is one of the highest-risk periods for your digital security. You are using unfamiliar networks, distracted by logistics, carrying devices full of personal data through airports and border crossings, and operating outside your normal routines. As part of your broader [digital privacy and online safety](/digital-privacy/) strategy, preparing your digital life for travel is just as important as packing your bags.

The risks are not theoretical. Travelers are specifically targeted by criminals who know that people in transit are more likely to connect to unsecured networks, click on unfamiliar links, and let their guard down. Add the legal complexities of border device searches and the patchwork of international [privacy laws](/digital-privacy/privacy-laws/), and travel becomes a significant cybersecurity event that deserves deliberate preparation.

## Before You Leave: The Pre-Departure Checklist

### Update Everything

In the weeks before your trip, ensure all your devices are running the latest operating system and app updates. Security patches address known vulnerabilities, and you do not want to be running outdated software on untrusted networks.

- Update iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to the latest versions
- Update all apps, especially your password manager, banking apps, and communication tools
- Update your router firmware at home -- your [home network](/digital-privacy/secure-home-wifi/) will be unattended while you are away

### Back Up Your Devices

Create a complete backup of every device you are taking. If a device is lost, stolen, or confiscated, you want to be able to restore from a backup when you return.

- **iPhone/iPad**: Back up to iCloud or your Mac via Finder
- **Mac**: Back up via Time Machine to an encrypted external drive, then leave the drive at home

### Review Your Password Manager

Ensure your [password manager](/password-managers/) is synced and contains all the credentials you might need while traveling. If you use PanicVault, verify that your KDBX database is synced to iCloud Drive so it is accessible across all your Apple devices. Consider whether you need offline access -- download your database locally before departing in case you find yourself without reliable internet.

### Set Up a VPN

If you do not already have a [VPN](/digital-privacy/vpn-guide/), set one up before you leave. Install and configure the VPN app on all your devices, test that it works, and enable auto-connect for untrusted networks. Do not wait until you are at the airport to figure this out.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication Everywhere

Verify that [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) is enabled on all your important accounts. If you use an authenticator app, make sure it is backed up and accessible on multiple devices. If you use SMS-based 2FA, be aware that your phone number may not work in all countries -- consider switching to an authenticator app before your trip.

Store your 2FA recovery codes in your password manager so you can access them if you lose your phone.

### Prepare for Border Searches

In many countries, border agents have the legal authority to search your electronic devices. The rules vary by country and situation, but you should be aware of the possibility and decide how to handle it in advance.

Options include:

- **Minimize data on travel devices** -- Use a travel-specific device with only the accounts and data you need for the trip
- **Log out of sensitive accounts** -- Remove the ability to access your most sensitive accounts from your travel device
- **Enable full disk encryption** -- FileVault on Mac, which is enabled by default on modern macOS
- **Know your rights** -- Research the laws of your destination country regarding device searches

### Notify Your Financial Institutions

Contact your bank and credit card companies to let them know you will be traveling. This prevents legitimate transactions from being flagged as fraud and ensures you can access your money. Note the international customer service numbers -- the toll-free numbers on the back of your cards may not work from abroad.

### Prepare Emergency Contacts and Information

Store critical information in your password manager:

- Bank fraud hotline international numbers
- Embassy contact information for your destination
- Travel insurance policy number and claims phone number
- Your [digital estate planning](/digital-privacy/digital-estate-planning/) documents should be updated to reflect your travel

### Enable Find My on All Devices

Ensure Find My is enabled on every Apple device you are carrying. This allows you to locate a lost device, remotely lock it, or remotely erase it if necessary.

## During Your Trip: In-Transit Security

### Airport and Airplane Security

- Use your phone's cellular hotspot rather than airport Wi-Fi when possible
- If you must use airport Wi-Fi, connect through your VPN and verify the network name -- airports are prime locations for [evil twin attacks](/digital-privacy/public-wifi-safety/)
- Do not charge your devices at public USB charging stations (use your own charger and a power outlet, or carry a portable battery). Public USB ports can be modified to transfer data -- a technique called "juice jacking"
- Be aware of shoulder surfing -- people watching as you enter passwords or PINs. Position your screen away from others, and use Face ID or Touch ID instead of typing passwords
- Keep your devices with you at all times. A device left unattended, even briefly, can be tampered with

### Hotel Security

- Treat hotel Wi-Fi as untrusted -- use your VPN for all connections
- Use the room safe for devices you are not carrying, though be aware that hotel safes are not highly secure
- Do not leave devices unattended in your room, especially visible on desks near windows
- Consider a "Do Not Disturb" sign to reduce the number of people entering your room
- Be cautious with hotel business center computers -- they may have keyloggers or other malware

### Daily Security Practices While Traveling

- **Check your accounts daily** -- Log in to your email and [banking apps](/digital-privacy/online-banking-security/) each day to monitor for unauthorized activity. You are more likely to be targeted while traveling, and early detection matters.
- **Use cellular data over Wi-Fi when possible** -- Cellular connections are significantly harder to intercept than Wi-Fi
- **Keep Bluetooth on "Contacts Only" for AirDrop** and avoid pairing with unfamiliar devices
- **Be cautious with QR codes** -- Tourist locations are popular spots for malicious QR codes overlaid on legitimate ones
- **Avoid printing or accessing sensitive documents on public printers or computers**
- **Lock your devices whenever you set them down** -- Even a momentary lapse can result in unauthorized access

### International Communication

- Use end-to-end encrypted messaging (iMessage between Apple devices, or Signal for cross-platform) for sensitive communications. See our [encryption explainer](/digital-privacy/e2e-encryption-explained/) for why this matters.
- Be aware that some countries restrict or monitor VPN usage
- Some countries actively monitor encrypted communications and may target travelers who use them
- Consider what you say and type -- assume that any communication on local infrastructure could be intercepted

### Handling Lost or Stolen Devices

If a device is lost or stolen:

1. **Immediately** use Find My (from another device or iCloud.com) to mark the device as lost
2. **Change passwords** for any accounts that were logged in on the device, starting with email
3. **Notify your bank** if banking apps were on the device
4. **Remote wipe** the device if you cannot recover it
5. **File a police report** for insurance purposes
6. **Review your accounts** for any unauthorized access that may have occurred before you noticed the loss

## After Your Trip: Post-Travel Cleanup

### Review Account Activity

When you return home and are back on trusted networks:

- Log in to all important accounts and review recent activity
- Check for new login sessions or authorized devices you do not recognize
- Review email forwarding rules and connected applications -- a sophisticated attacker might have set up persistent access
- Check your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar transactions

### Change Sensitive Passwords

If you used any passwords on potentially compromised networks, change them. This is especially important for:

- Email accounts
- Banking and financial accounts
- Your password manager's master password (if you suspect any compromise)
- Social media accounts

### Remove Travel-Specific Configurations

- Disconnect from any hotel or travel Wi-Fi networks stored on your devices (Settings > Wi-Fi > forget network)
- Disable any VPN configurations you created specifically for the trip
- Remove any temporary apps you installed for travel
- Revoke access to any services you granted during the trip

### Update Your Devices Again

Install any updates that were released during your trip. Traveling devices that have been connected to unfamiliar networks should be patched as soon as possible.

### Restore Normal Security Settings

If you relaxed any security settings for convenience while traveling (like disabling auto-lock), restore them to their normal, more secure configurations.

## Special Considerations for Different Destinations

### High-Risk Countries

Some countries have more aggressive surveillance, device search policies, or cyber-criminal activity. For these destinations:

- Consider using a dedicated travel device with minimal data
- Use a freshly installed operating system
- Only install apps you need for the trip
- Do not log in to your primary personal accounts from the travel device
- Use a separate email account for travel bookings and communications

### Business Travel

If you are traveling for work, your organization may have specific cybersecurity policies. Follow them. Additionally:

- Keep business and personal devices separate if possible
- Do not connect personal devices to corporate networks or vice versa
- Be aware that business travelers are high-value targets for corporate espionage
- Report any security incidents to your IT department immediately

### Long-Term Travel

If you are traveling for extended periods:

- Set up automated monitoring for your home network
- Ensure your [digital estate plan](/digital-privacy/digital-estate-planning/) is current -- extended travel increases the importance of having someone who can access your accounts if needed
- Consider a virtual mailbox service for any physical mail related to your digital accounts
- Keep your password manager database backed up in multiple locations

## A Travel Cybersecurity Packing List

Beyond physical items, prepare these digital essentials:

- [ ] All devices updated to latest OS and apps
- [ ] Full backups of all devices completed
- [ ] Password manager synced with all needed credentials
