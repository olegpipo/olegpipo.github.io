Older adults are disproportionately targeted by online scammers and cybercriminals. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center reports that adults over 60 lose more money to online fraud than any other age group, with losses exceeding billions of dollars annually. As part of a family approach to [digital privacy and online safety](/digital-privacy/), helping the older adults in your life navigate cybersecurity is both a practical necessity and an act of care.

This guide is designed to be shared. It is written for family members who want to help parents, grandparents, or other older loved ones stay safe online -- but it is also written to be readable and useful for seniors themselves. The tone is respectful, the language avoids unnecessary jargon, and the advice is practical.

## Why Seniors Are Targeted

Understanding why scammers target older adults is the first step toward defense.

**Financial resources** -- Older adults often have retirement savings, home equity, and other assets that make them lucrative targets.

**Trust and politeness** -- Many older adults grew up in an era when phone calls and official-looking communications were generally trustworthy. This makes them more likely to engage with scammers rather than hanging up or deleting suspicious messages.

**Digital unfamiliarity** -- While many seniors are comfortable with technology, the pace of change in scam tactics means that even tech-savvy older adults can be caught off guard by new approaches.

**Social isolation** -- Lonely individuals are more vulnerable to scams that involve personal connection -- romance scams, fake customer service calls, and impersonation of family members.

**Reluctance to report** -- Seniors who fall victim to scams often feel embarrassed and do not report the crime, which means scammers face little consequence and are encouraged to target this demographic.

## The Most Common Scams Targeting Seniors

### The "Grandparent Scam"

A caller claims to be a grandchild in trouble -- arrested, in a car accident, stranded abroad -- and urgently needs money. They may say "Don't tell Mom and Dad" to prevent the target from verifying the story. With AI voice cloning becoming more accessible, these calls can now sound convincingly like the actual grandchild.

**Defense**: Establish a family code word that only real family members know. If someone calls claiming to be a family member in distress, ask for the code word. Always verify by calling the supposed family member directly at their known phone number.

### Tech Support Scams

A pop-up message, phone call, or email claims that the computer has a virus and needs immediate repair. The scammer then requests remote access to the computer, installs software, and charges for unnecessary "repairs" -- or worse, uses the access to steal personal information.

**Defense**: No legitimate company will contact you unsolicited about a computer problem. Apple, Microsoft, and Google do not call customers to inform them of viruses. If a pop-up appears, close the browser (Force Quit if necessary). Never give remote access to someone who contacted you.

### Phishing Emails and Texts

Messages that appear to come from banks, Medicare, Social Security, Amazon, or other trusted institutions, asking you to click a link or provide personal information. These are often well-crafted and can be difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications. For comprehensive guidance, see our [phishing protection guide](/phishing/).

**Defense**: Never click links in unexpected emails or texts. If you need to contact your bank or check your account, open your browser and type the address directly, or call the number on your card.

### Romance Scams

A person met through a dating site, social media, or even a mobile game develops an online relationship over weeks or months, eventually requesting money for emergencies, travel, or medical bills. These scams can be devastatingly effective because they exploit genuine emotional connections.

**Defense**: Be extremely cautious about anyone met online who asks for money, regardless of the emotional connection. A person who refuses to video call or meet in person, claims to be overseas, and requests wire transfers or gift cards is almost certainly a scammer.

### Medicare and Health Insurance Scams

Callers claim to be from Medicare, offering free equipment, requesting your Medicare number for a "new card," or threatening to cancel your coverage if you do not verify information.

**Defense**: Medicare will never call you unsolicited to ask for your personal information. Do not share your Medicare number with anyone who contacts you. Call Medicare directly at 1-800-MEDICARE if you have concerns.

### Investment Scams

Promises of guaranteed returns, cryptocurrency opportunities, or exclusive investments target older adults with retirement savings. These often come through social media, phone calls, or even through acquaintances who have themselves been recruited into the scheme.

**Defense**: If an investment sounds too good to be true, it is. Legitimate investments involve risk, and no one can guarantee returns. Verify any investment opportunity with a trusted financial advisor before sending money.

## Building a Secure Foundation

### Setting Up a Password Manager

The single most impactful security tool for anyone managing online accounts is a [password manager](/password-managers/). For seniors, the challenge is often adoption -- the tool needs to be simple enough that it becomes helpful rather than an additional source of confusion.

PanicVault is designed specifically for the Apple ecosystem and works with the system-wide AutoFill on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This means:

- Passwords appear automatically when logging in to websites and apps
- Face ID or Touch ID unlocks the vault -- no need to remember a complex master password for day-to-day use
- All credentials are stored in one secure location

For a family member helping set this up:

1. Install the password manager on all of the senior's Apple devices
2. Set up Face ID/Touch ID as the primary unlock method
3. Write down the master password and store it in a secure physical location (like a fireproof safe)
4. Migrate existing passwords from the browser or written notes into the password manager
5. Generate new, strong passwords for the most important accounts (email, banking, Medicare portal)
6. Spend time practicing together -- the senior should be comfortable using AutoFill before you leave

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

[Two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) adds critical protection but can be confusing. For seniors:

- Set up an authenticator app (many password managers include TOTP support) rather than SMS codes
- Walk through the process together on a few accounts so it becomes familiar
- Ensure backup codes are saved in the password manager
- Consider hardware security keys for the most tech-savvy seniors -- they are actually simpler than codes in practice (just plug in and tap)

### Securing Email

Email is the skeleton key to all other accounts. Our [email security guide](/digital-privacy/secure-email/) covers the details, but the essentials for seniors are:

- Use a strong, unique password for email (stored in the password manager)
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Never click links in emails claiming to be from banks, government agencies, or tech companies
- If an email seems urgent or threatening, it is almost certainly a scam

### Device Security

- Keep the iPhone, iPad, or Mac updated to the latest operating system version. Enable automatic updates.
- Set a strong device passcode (at least 6 digits, ideally alphanumeric)
- Enable Face ID or Touch ID
- Enable Find My so lost devices can be located or remotely erased
- Only install apps from the Apple App Store

## The Family Support System

### Regular Check-Ins

Schedule periodic "digital wellness" check-ins with your older family members:

- Review their recent emails for anything suspicious
- Check for unfamiliar apps installed on their devices
- Look for unexpected charges on their bank or credit card statements
- Update their devices if automatic updates are not enabled
- Ask if they have received any suspicious calls or messages

### Designate a Tech Contact

Every senior should have a trusted family member or friend they can call before acting on anything suspicious. Make it clear that it is always better to check and have it be nothing than to act and lose money.

Establish the ground rule: "Before you click a link, give money to anyone, or provide personal information to someone who contacted you, call me first."

### Protect Against Isolation-Based Scams

Staying socially connected is a security measure. Seniors who have regular contact with family and friends are:

- Less vulnerable to romance scams
- More likely to mention a suspicious contact to someone who recognizes it as a scam
- Less likely to make decisions based on urgency and fear

## Red Flags to Watch For

Teach these universal red flags:

1. **Urgency** -- "You must act immediately" or "This offer expires in 24 hours"
2. **Secrecy** -- "Don't tell your family about this"
3. **Unusual payment methods** -- Gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, or payment apps for transactions with strangers
4. **Unsolicited contact** -- Any call, email, or message you did not initiate that asks for money or information
5. **Too good to be true** -- Lottery winnings you did not enter, inheritance from unknown relatives, guaranteed investment returns
6. **Emotional manipulation** -- Fear ("your account will be closed"), love ("I need help"), authority ("this is the IRS")

## What to Do If a Scam Succeeds

If a senior has fallen victim to a scam:

1. **Do not blame them.** Shame is the scammer's ally -- it prevents reporting and makes the victim less likely to seek help.
2. **Contact the bank immediately** if money was sent. Some transactions can be reversed if caught quickly.
3. **Change passwords** on any compromised accounts, starting with email and banking.
4. **Report the scam:**
   - FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov
   - FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov
   - State Attorney General's office
   - Local police department
5. **Place a fraud alert** on credit reports through any of the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
6. **Monitor accounts** closely for weeks after the incident -- scammers may try again or share the target's information with other criminals
7. **Provide emotional support.** Being scammed can be traumatic. The financial loss hurts, but the feeling of violation and the fear of being targeted again can be worse.
