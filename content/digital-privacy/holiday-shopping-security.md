Holiday shopping season is peak season for cybercriminals. The combination of high transaction volume, time pressure, emotional decision-making, and unfamiliar websites creates ideal conditions for fraud, phishing, and account compromise. As part of your overall [digital privacy and online safety](/digital-privacy/) strategy, preparing for the holiday shopping period is a specific, time-sensitive priority.

The numbers tell the story. With 3.4 billion phishing emails sent daily throughout the year, that volume spikes significantly during the November-December holiday period. Fake retail sites proliferate, shipping notification scams flood inboxes, and the urgency of limited-time deals overrides the caution that might otherwise prevent someone from clicking a suspicious link.

## The Holiday-Specific Threats

### Phishing Emails and Texts

Holiday phishing campaigns are sophisticated because they exploit legitimate shopping behavior. You are expecting order confirmations, shipping notifications, and delivery updates -- so a fake email that says "Your package delivery failed" looks entirely plausible.

Common holiday phishing tactics:

- **Fake shipping notifications** from "FedEx," "UPS," or "USPS" with tracking links that lead to malware or credential-harvesting sites
- **Order confirmation emails** from "Amazon" or other major retailers for orders you did not place, prompting you to "click here to dispute"
- **Deal alerts** advertising impossibly good prices that link to counterfeit retail sites
- **Gift card scams** -- emails claiming you have received a digital gift card, with a link to "claim" it
- **Charity scams** -- fake donation solicitations that increase during the giving season

For comprehensive phishing defense, see our [phishing protection guide](/phishing/).

### Fake Retail Websites

Counterfeit e-commerce sites are designed to look like legitimate retailers but exist solely to steal your payment information and personal data. They appear in search ads, social media advertisements, and phishing emails.

Red flags for fake retail sites:

- Prices that are dramatically lower than any legitimate retailer
- A domain name that is similar to but not exactly a known brand (amazom.com, target-deals.shop)
- No physical address or contact information
- Only accepts payment methods that offer no buyer protection (wire transfer, cryptocurrency, gift cards)
- Recently registered domain (you can check at whois.com)
- Poor grammar and inconsistent design
- No clear return policy or terms of service

### Payment Card Skimming

Online credit card skimming (also called Magecart attacks or formjacking) involves malicious code injected into legitimate retail websites that captures your credit card information as you type it. This affects real, trusted websites that have been compromised -- not just sketchy sites you should have avoided.

### Account Takeover

The holiday season sees increased credential stuffing attacks, where stolen username/password combinations from [data breaches](/data-breaches/) are tested against retail accounts. If you reuse passwords, an attacker who obtains your credentials from one breach can access your accounts elsewhere and make purchases with your saved payment methods.

## Protecting Yourself Before You Shop

### Secure Your Accounts First

Before the shopping season begins:

- **Update passwords** on your most-used retail accounts -- Amazon, Target, Walmart, and any others where you have saved payment information. Use your [password manager](/password-managers/) to generate strong, unique passwords.
- **Enable two-factor authentication** on every retail account that supports it. See our [2FA guide](/two-factor-authentication/).
- **Remove saved payment methods** from accounts you rarely use. Only keep payment information stored on sites you trust and use frequently.
- **Review authorized devices** on your retail accounts and remove any you do not recognize.

### Set Up Transaction Alerts

Enable notifications from your bank and credit card companies for all transactions. Many banks allow you to set custom thresholds -- even $1. This way you will know immediately if an unauthorized charge appears, rather than discovering it weeks later on a statement.

### Prepare Your Devices

- Update your phone, tablet, and computer operating systems and browsers
- Only install retail apps from official app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play)
- Be cautious with browser extensions that claim to find deals or apply coupons -- many collect your browsing and purchase data

## Safe Shopping Practices

### Use Credit Cards, Not Debit Cards

Credit cards offer significantly better fraud protection than debit cards. With a credit card, unauthorized charges can be disputed and reversed before you pay. With a debit card, the money leaves your account immediately, and recovering it takes longer and is less certain.

### Consider Virtual Card Numbers

Some banks and services offer virtual card numbers -- unique card numbers generated for each merchant or transaction. If a virtual card number is compromised, the attacker gets a number that only works at one merchant and can be easily canceled. Apple Pay and Google Pay also generate unique transaction numbers.

### Shop on Trusted Networks

Do your shopping on your [secure home Wi-Fi network](/digital-privacy/secure-home-wifi/) or your cellular data connection. Avoid entering payment information on [public Wi-Fi](/digital-privacy/public-wifi-safety/) -- even with a VPN, the risk is not worth it when you have safer alternatives.

### Go Directly to Retailer Websites

Never click links in emails or advertisements to reach a shopping site. Instead, type the retailer's URL directly in your browser or use a bookmark you have saved previously. This simple habit defeats most phishing attempts.

### Verify HTTPS

Before entering any payment or personal information, verify that the site uses HTTPS (look for the padlock icon in the address bar). HTTPS does not guarantee a site is legitimate -- a scam site can have HTTPS too -- but the absence of HTTPS is a definitive red flag.

### Use Apple Pay When Available

Apple Pay (and similar tokenized payment methods) never shares your actual card number with the merchant. Each transaction uses a unique device account number and transaction-specific code. This means that even if the merchant is breached, your real card number is not exposed.

### Be Skeptical of Deals That Seem Too Good

If a deal seems impossibly good, it probably is not real. Scam sites rely on greed and urgency to override judgment. A 90% discount on a current-model MacBook is not a deal -- it is a trap.

### Check Return Policies Before Buying

Legitimate retailers have clear, accessible return policies. If you cannot find a return policy, or if the policy is vague or unreasonable, that is a warning sign.

## During and After Shopping Season

### Monitor Your Accounts

Throughout the shopping season and for at least a month afterward:

- Review bank and credit card statements weekly
- Check for unfamiliar charges, even small ones (attackers often test with small transactions before making larger ones)
- Monitor your email for unexpected password reset requests or order confirmations for purchases you did not make
- Review your credit report for any new accounts you did not open

### Manage Your Inbox Carefully

After the shopping season, you will receive a flood of marketing emails from retailers you purchased from. This creates two problems:

1. **Phishing camouflage** -- Attackers send fake marketing emails that blend in with the legitimate flood
2. **Data exposure** -- Every retailer on your email list has your email address and potentially more personal data

Consider unsubscribing from retailers you do not plan to buy from again. For future shopping, use email aliases or relay addresses to limit the spread of your primary email address.

### Secure New Devices

If you purchased or received new devices as gifts, set them up securely:

- Set strong device passcodes and enable biometric authentication
- Enable Find My on Apple devices
- Install a password manager and start using unique passwords. For Apple devices, [PanicVault](https://panicvault.com) is a native macOS/iOS app that works with the KeePass KDBX format -- a great choice for anyone in the Apple ecosystem.
- Enable [two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/) on all accounts you add to the device
- Follow our [guide for new devices](/guides/) to set up security properly from the start

### Save Receipts Securely

Digital receipts and order confirmations contain personal data -- your name, address, email, and sometimes partial payment information. Store them securely and delete them from your email once the return window has passed.

## Gift Card Safety

Gift cards are a favorite tool of scammers -- both as a payment method they request from victims and as a product that is frequently counterfeited.

### When Buying Gift Cards

- Buy directly from the retailer (in-store or from their official website)
- Inspect physical cards for signs of tampering (scratched or visible PINs, damaged packaging)
- Avoid buying gift cards from third-party resellers unless they are well-established and offer buyer protection
- Save the receipt

### When Receiving Gift Cards

- Redeem gift cards promptly -- the longer a card sits unused, the more time a scammer who may have skimmed the number has to drain it
- If a "friend" or "employer" asks you to buy gift cards and send them the codes, it is a scam. Always. No legitimate business or personal transaction requires gift card payment.

## Teaching Your Family

The holiday shopping season is a good time to have security conversations with family members, especially those who may be less security-aware:

- Help older relatives recognize [phishing attempts](/phishing/) disguised as shipping notifications
- Set up or review [password managers](/password-managers/) for family members
- Enable two-factor authentication on their retail and financial accounts
- For children who are shopping online, review [online safety basics](/digital-privacy/children-online-safety/)

For seniors in particular, our [cybersecurity for seniors guide](/digital-privacy/cybersecurity-seniors/) covers the specific threats they face.
