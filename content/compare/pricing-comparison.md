Password manager pricing is deliberately confusing. Monthly rates that are only available with annual billing. Features split across tiers with names like "Premium," "Professional," and "Teams" that blur together. Free tiers that are too limited to use but too present to ignore in marketing. This guide, part of our [password manager comparisons hub](/compare/), lays out the actual costs with no ambiguity, so you can make a budget-conscious decision without deciphering pricing pages designed to steer you toward the most expensive option.

All prices are current as of early 2026. Prices change -- check the official sites for the latest numbers.

## Individual Plans

| Password Manager | Free Tier | Individual Price | Annual Cost | Billing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1Password | None | $2.99/month | $35.88/year | Annual only |
| Bitwarden | Yes (full) | $0.83/month | $10/year | Annual only |
| Dashlane | Limited (25 passwords, 1 device) | $4.99/month | $59.88/year | Annual only |
| Proton Pass | Yes (basic) | $1.99/month | $23.88/year | Annual only |
| NordPass | Limited | $1.49/month | $17.88/year | Annual (2-year deals available) |

| Apple Passwords | Full (built-in) | $0 | $0 | N/A |

### What the Tiers Actually Get You

**1Password ($35.88/year)**: Everything. There is no free or cheaper tier. You get unlimited passwords, all devices, Watchtower monitoring, passkey support, 1GB document storage, and shared vaults. The price is the price.

**Bitwarden Free ($0)**: Unlimited passwords, unlimited devices, sync, password generator, and basic 2FA for your account. This is a fully functional password manager. **Bitwarden Premium ($10/year)**: Adds TOTP authenticator, 1GB file storage, emergency access, Vault Health Reports, and advanced 2FA options (YubiKey, FIDO2).

**Dashlane Free ($0)**: 25 passwords on a single device. This is effectively a trial. **Dashlane Premium ($59.88/year)**: Unlimited passwords and devices, VPN, dark web monitoring, and password health scoring.

**PanicVault (one-time)**: All features included at purchase. TOTP codes, groups, custom fields, AutoFill, iCloud and Google Drive sync, Face ID/Touch ID. No feature gating.

**Strongbox (freemium)**: Free tier is read-only -- you can view databases but not edit them. Pro unlocks full editing, TOTP, and other features. Available as a subscription or a one-time lifetime purchase at $29.99.

**KeePassXC ($0)**: Every feature is available for free. TOTP, SSH agent, Auto-Type, YubiKey, custom fields, attachments. The only "limitation" is that it is desktop-only.

**Apple Passwords ($0)**: Built into every Apple device. Passwords, passkeys, TOTP codes, and sharing -- all free. Limited organizational features and no cross-platform support beyond a basic Windows extension.

## Family Plans

| Password Manager | Family Price | Members | Per-Person Annual | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1Password | $4.99/month | Up to 5 | $11.98 | $59.88/year total |
| Bitwarden | $3.33/month | Up to 6 | $6.67 | $40/year total |
| Dashlane | $7.49/month | Up to 10 | $8.99 | $89.88/year total |
| Proton Pass | $3.99/month | Up to 6 | $7.98 | $47.88/year total |
| NordPass | $2.79/month | Up to 6 | $5.58 | $33.48/year total |
| PanicVault | Per-device purchase | Unlimited | Fixed | App Store Family Sharing available |
| Strongbox | Per-device purchase | Unlimited | Fixed | App Store Family Sharing available |
| KeePassXC | $0 | Unlimited | $0 | Share database file |
| Apple Passwords | $0 | Unlimited | $0 | iCloud sharing groups |

### Family Plan Analysis

**Best per-person value (subscription)**: Bitwarden at $6.67 per person per year for a full household. Bitwarden Families is the clear winner for budget-conscious families who want a subscription service. See our [best password manager for families](/compare/best-for-families/) guide.

**Best per-person value (overall)**: KeePassXC and Apple Passwords are free for any number of family members. PanicVault's one-time purchase with App Store Family Sharing is the cheapest paid option over time.

**Most members**: Dashlane supports up to 10 family members, making its per-person cost competitive only if you fill most seats.

## Cost Over Time

The real cost of a password manager is not the monthly price -- it is the total you pay over years.

### Individual Plans: 5-Year Cost

| Password Manager | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Year 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1Password | $35.88 | $71.76 | $107.64 | $179.40 | $358.80 |
| Bitwarden Premium | $10.00 | $20.00 | $30.00 | $50.00 | $100.00 |
| Dashlane Premium | $59.88 | $119.76 | $179.64 | $299.40 | $598.80 |
| Proton Pass Plus | $23.88 | $47.76 | $71.64 | $119.40 | $238.80 |
| NordPass Premium | $17.88 | $35.76 | $53.64 | $89.40 | $178.80 |
| PanicVault | One-time | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Strongbox Lifetime | $29.99 | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| KeePassXC | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Apple Passwords | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |

### Family Plans: 5-Year Cost

| Password Manager | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Year 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1Password Family | $59.88 | $179.64 | $299.40 | $598.80 |
| Bitwarden Family | $40.00 | $120.00 | $200.00 | $400.00 |
| Dashlane Family | $89.88 | $269.64 | $449.40 | $898.80 |
| PanicVault | One-time per user | -- | -- | -- |
| KeePassXC | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Apple Passwords | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |

The difference is stark. Over ten years, Dashlane costs a single user nearly $600. Bitwarden Premium costs $100. PanicVault and KeePassXC cost nothing beyond the initial purchase (or nothing at all).

## Hidden Costs and Considerations

### Price Increases

Subscription prices can increase. 1Password's individual price has risen over the years. When you subscribe, you commit to whatever the company decides to charge in the future, or you migrate away (which has its own cost in time and effort).

One-time purchases and free tools do not have this problem. A database file you paid for once continues working indefinitely.

### Switching Costs

If you decide to leave a subscription service after years of use, migrating hundreds of credentials takes time. Export formats vary in quality -- some lose metadata, custom fields, or TOTP configurations. This hidden cost of switching makes the initial choice more consequential than the monthly price suggests.

Tools that use the open KDBX format (PanicVault, KeePassXC, Strongbox) have zero switching costs within the KeePass ecosystem. Moving from 1Password to Bitwarden (or vice versa) requires a careful export/import process.

### What "Free" Actually Means

Free tools monetize differently:

- **KeePassXC**: Volunteer-maintained, funded by donations. No monetization of user data.
- **Apple Passwords**: Free because Apple monetizes hardware. iCloud Keychain drives Apple device loyalty.
- **Bitwarden Free**: Free tier drives upgrades to Premium and business plans.
- **Dashlane Free**: The 25-password limit is designed to force an upgrade, not to be genuinely usable.

Understanding the incentive model helps you assess long-term sustainability. KeePassXC has operated on donations for years. Apple Passwords will exist as long as Apple sells devices. Bitwarden's business model depends on enterprise customers, making the free consumer tier a stable acquisition tool.

## Student and Academic Pricing

Some password managers offer student discounts:

- **1Password**: Occasionally offers student promotions or extended free trials (check their education page)
- **Bitwarden**: No specific student discount, but the free tier is more than adequate and Premium is only $10/year
- **Dashlane**: Has offered student discounts in the past (verify current availability)
- **NordPass**: Bundled with NordVPN student discounts

For students, the free options (Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Apple Passwords) are typically the best choice. See our [best password manager for students](/compare/best-for-students/) guide.

## Business and Team Plans

For completeness, though this site focuses on personal use:

| Password Manager | Team Price | Per User/Month | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1Password Business | $7.99/user/month | $7.99 | Advanced admin controls |
| Bitwarden Teams | $4/user/month | $4.00 | |
| Bitwarden Enterprise | $6/user/month | $6.00 | SSO, policies |
| Dashlane Business | $8/user/month | $8.00 | VPN included |

Business plans are outside the scope of this comparison but are relevant if you are a freelancer or small business owner evaluating options for your team.

## Recommendations by Budget

### Zero Budget

**Bitwarden Free** for cross-platform. **Apple Passwords** for Apple-only. **KeePassXC** for desktop power users. All three are genuinely good at $0. See our [best free password managers guide](/compare/best-free-password-managers/).

### Minimal Budget ($10-30/year)

**Bitwarden Premium** at $10/year adds TOTP codes and file storage to an already-capable free tier. **PanicVault** (one-time purchase) is the best long-term value for Apple users.

### Comfort Budget ($30-60/year)

**1Password** at $35.88/year provides the most polished experience. **Strongbox Lifetime** at $29.99 gives you a full-featured KeePass client forever. See [PanicVault vs. 1Password](/compare/panicvault-vs-1password/) for the detailed comparison.

### Money Is Not the Constraint

**1Password** for the best UX. **PanicVault + KeePassXC** for the best combination of Apple integration and data portability. The most expensive option is not always the best option -- spend based on features you need, not on marketing that suggests you should pay more.

## The Bottom Line

Password manager pricing ranges from completely free to $60/year. The expensive options are not proportionally better than the cheap ones -- they offer different features and trade-offs. Bitwarden at $10/year and PanicVault's one-time purchase offer the best value. KeePassXC and Apple Passwords offer the best price (free). 1Password and Dashlane offer the most features at the highest cost.

Do not let pricing complexity prevent you from using a password manager. Even the most expensive option on this list costs less per month than a cup of coffee. And the free options are genuinely excellent.
