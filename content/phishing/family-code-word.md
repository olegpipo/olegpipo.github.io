A family code word is one of the simplest and most effective defenses against the fastest-growing category of fraud in 2026. As [deepfake voice cloning scams](/phishing/deepfake-voice-scams/) surge -- with voice cloning fraud up 400% in 2025 -- the ability to verify that you are actually speaking to a family member, and not an AI replica of their voice, has become a critical security measure. This article is part of our [Phishing & Social Engineering](/phishing/) guide and walks you through setting up a family code word system that works.

## Why You Need a Family Code Word

Voice cloning technology can replicate a person's voice from just a few seconds of audio. That audio is readily available from social media posts, voicemail greetings, and public recordings. Once an attacker has a voice clone, they can make phone calls that sound exactly like your spouse, your child, your parent, or your grandchild.

The typical attack follows a pattern: you receive a frantic call from someone who sounds exactly like a family member. They are in distress -- an accident, an arrest, a medical emergency. They need money immediately. The emotional shock of hearing a loved one in danger overrides the critical thinking that would normally protect you. People send thousands of dollars before realizing the call was fake.

A family code word short-circuits this attack. When anyone in your family calls with an emergency, you ask for the code word. If they can provide it, the call is legitimate. If they cannot, you hang up and call your family member directly.

## How to Choose a Good Code Word

### What Makes an Effective Code Word

Your family code word should be:

- **Uncommon in daily conversation** -- Do not pick a word that might naturally come up in speech. "Pineapple" is better than "hello" but still too common. Aim for something distinctive.
- **Memorable for everyone** -- A word that is too obscure will be forgotten. It needs to stick in everyone's memory, including children and elderly family members.
- **Not guessable from public information** -- Do not use your pet's name, your street name, your school, or anything that appears on social media or could be discovered through research.
- **Easy to say under stress** -- If someone actually were in an emergency, they should be able to recall and say the word clearly.

### Good Examples

These are not your code words (never use examples from a public article), but they illustrate the right type:

- A combination of two unrelated words: "telescope pancake" or "marble umbrella."
- A memorable phrase: "purple elephants dancing" or "the lighthouse remembers."
- A reference to a private family joke or memory that would not be known outside the family.

### What to Avoid

- **Pet names, birthdays, addresses** -- These are discoverable through social media and public records.
- **Common security answers** -- Mother's maiden name, first car, high school mascot. These are used in account recovery and may already be compromised in [data breaches](/data-breaches/).
- **Single common words** -- "Apple," "sunshine," "password." Too easily guessed.
- **Anything posted online** -- If you have shared it on social media, assume an attacker knows it.

## How to Set Up Your Family Code Word

### Step 1: Choose the Word Together

Have a conversation with your family -- ideally in person. Explain why you need a code word (you can share this article or describe [how voice cloning works](/phishing/deepfake-voice-scams/)). Let everyone participate in choosing the word. People remember things better when they helped create them.

### Step 2: Practice Using It

After choosing the code word, practice. Have family members call each other and ask for it. This accomplishes two things: it ensures everyone remembers the word, and it normalizes the process of asking for verification. You want the response to be automatic, not something that requires remembering "oh, right, we set up that code word."

### Step 3: Establish the Protocol

Everyone in the family should understand the procedure:

1. If you receive an unexpected call claiming to be from a family member -- especially one involving urgency, distress, or money -- ask for the code word.
2. If the caller provides the correct code word, proceed with the conversation while remaining appropriately cautious.
3. If the caller cannot provide the code word, **hang up immediately** and call the family member directly using their number from your contacts.
4. If the caller gives an excuse for not knowing the code word ("I forgot," "I can't think right now," "just trust me"), hang up. A real family member, even in distress, will remember the code word -- you practiced it for this reason.

### Step 4: Include Everyone

Make sure the code word reaches every family member who might receive or be impersonated in a scam call:

- **Elderly grandparents** -- They are the most frequently targeted demographic. Visit them in person to explain the system and practice.
- **College-age children** -- They are often impersonated in "I'm in trouble" calls to parents.
- **Spouses and partners** -- Can be impersonated in financial or emergency scenarios.
- **Babysitters, nannies, caregivers** -- Anyone who might receive emergency calls about family members.

### Step 5: Refresh Periodically

Change your family code word every 6-12 months. Memories fade, and there is a small chance the code word could be inadvertently exposed. Use the renewal as an opportunity to remind everyone about the protocol and discuss any new scam tactics you have encountered.

## Advanced Tips

### Multiple Code Words for Different Situations

Some families use a two-tier system:

- **Verification word**: Used to confirm identity during unexpected calls.
- **Duress word**: A different word that signals "I am saying I'm okay, but I'm actually in danger." This is useful in rare scenarios where someone is being coerced.

### Code Word for Non-Family Contexts

The concept extends beyond family. Consider establishing code words with:

- **Close friends** who might be impersonated.
- **Business partners** for verifying unusual financial requests.
- **Elderly neighbors** whom you check on regularly.

### Pair with Technical Defenses

A family code word is one layer of defense. Complement it with:

- **[Password managers](/password-managers/)** like PanicVault to prevent credential theft through phishing. A voice clone cannot extract a password from your vault -- PanicVault requires Face ID or Touch ID to access your credentials.
- **[Two-factor authentication](/two-factor-authentication/)** on all accounts to prevent unauthorized access even if personal information is compromised during a scam call.
- **Call screening** -- Enable silence unknown callers on your iPhone to send suspected spam calls directly to voicemail.
- **[Strong, unique passwords](/password-security/)** so that even if an attacker gains one credential through social engineering, it does not cascade to other accounts.

## How to Talk to Elderly Family Members About Code Words

Elderly family members are the primary targets of voice cloning scams, but they can also be the hardest to convince. Here are approaches that work:

### Lead with Stories, Not Technology

Do not start by explaining AI voice cloning technology. Start with a story: "There are scammers who can make phone calls that sound exactly like me or [grandchild's name]. They trick people into sending money by pretending to be in an emergency." Stories are more memorable and persuasive than technical explanations.

### Frame It as Protection, Not Fear

"We're setting this up because we love you and want to make sure no one can pretend to be us" is better than "you could lose thousands of dollars to scammers." Focus on the positive action they can take rather than the threat.

### Make It Simple

One code word. One rule: if someone calls claiming to be family and asking for money, ask for the code word first. That is it. Do not overwhelm with technical details or multiple procedures.

### Write It Down Securely

For elderly family members who might forget, write the code word on a card and keep it somewhere secure -- in a wallet, in a bedside drawer, or taped inside a kitchen cabinet. It should not be labeled "family code word" or be immediately recognizable to a visitor.

### Practice Regularly

Call your elderly family members periodically and work the code word into conversation naturally. "Hey Grandma, just checking in. Remember our special word? Want to tell me what it is?" Regular reinforcement prevents the code word from fading from memory.

## What to Do When the Code Word System Catches a Scam

If you ask for the code word and the caller cannot provide it:

1. **Hang up immediately.** Do not engage, argue, or provide information.
2. **Call your family member directly** using their number from your contacts to confirm they are safe.
3. **Report the attempt** to local law enforcement and the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. See [how to report phishing](/phishing/report-phishing/) for complete instructions.
4. **Alert other family members** that someone has attempted a voice cloning scam targeting your family. They may be next.
5. **Review your family's online presence** -- Consider whether there are social media posts or other public audio that the scammer used as source material.

## Five Minutes That Could Save You Thousands

Setting up a family code word takes five minutes. A single voice cloning scam can cost tens of thousands of dollars and cause lasting emotional damage. The math is simple. Have the conversation today. Choose the word. Practice it. Make sure your elderly family members understand the protocol.

In an era of [AI-powered scams](/phishing/ai-powered-phishing/), the most powerful defense is sometimes the most human: a secret word shared between people who trust each other.
