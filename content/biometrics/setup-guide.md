Enabling biometric unlock on your password vault is one of the most impactful security improvements you can make -- not because the biometric itself is the security, but because it removes the friction that prevents most people from using a truly strong master password. This guide walks you through setting up Face ID and Touch ID for your password vault on every Apple device type, with specific instructions for PanicVault and general guidance applicable to other [password managers](/password-managers/). Consider this your practical companion to the broader [biometric security](/biometrics/) guide.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling biometric unlock on your password vault, make sure the following are in place:

### 1. A Strong Master Password

Your master password is the cryptographic foundation of your vault. Biometric unlock does not replace it -- it provides a faster way to access the vault key that is derived from it. Before enabling biometric unlock, set (or verify) a strong master password.

A strong master password should be:

- **Long**: At least 20 characters. With biometric unlock, you will rarely type it, so length is not a daily burden.
- **Random**: Not based on personal information, dictionary words in predictable patterns, or common phrases. Use a passphrase generated by dice rolls or a random word generator.
- **Unique**: Not used for any other purpose. Your vault master password should exist only for your vault.

Write your master password down and store it in a physically secure location (a locked drawer, a safe deposit box) until you have memorized it. Once memorized, destroy the written copy or keep it as an emergency backup in a secure location.

### 2. Biometric Hardware Enrolled

Ensure Face ID or Touch ID is set up on your device:

- **iPhone/iPad with Face ID**: Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Set Up Face ID. Follow the prompts to complete two head rotations.
- **iPhone/iPad with Touch ID**: Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Add a Fingerprint. Place and lift your finger repeatedly as guided.
- **Mac with Touch ID**: System Settings > Touch ID & Password > Add Fingerprint. Follow the on-screen instructions.

If you have already set up biometrics for device unlock, no additional enrollment is needed. Apps use the same biometric enrollment that your device uses.

### 3. Updated Operating System

Ensure your device is running a recent version of iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. Biometric security improvements are delivered through operating system updates, and older versions may lack important anti-spoofing enhancements. Apple's [Secure Enclave](/apple/secure-enclave/) firmware is also updated through OS updates.

## Setting Up PanicVault with Face ID (iPhone and iPad)

PanicVault natively supports Face ID on all iPhone and iPad models equipped with the TrueDepth camera system.

### Step 1: Open or Create Your Vault

If you are setting up PanicVault for the first time:

1. Download PanicVault from the App Store.
2. Choose "Create New Database" or "Open Existing Database" if you have a KeePass (.kdbx) file.
3. For a new database, set your master password. For an existing database, enter the master password to unlock it.

### Step 2: Enable Face ID Unlock

1. With your vault unlocked, open PanicVault's settings (typically accessible through a gear icon or settings menu).
2. Find the "Face ID" or "Biometric Unlock" option.
3. Toggle it on.
4. PanicVault will prompt Face ID to verify your identity. This initial verification confirms that you are the person enabling biometric access.
5. Upon successful verification, PanicVault stores a copy of your vault decryption key in the Secure Enclave, protected by your Face ID enrollment.

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Lock PanicVault manually or wait for the auto-lock timeout.
2. Open PanicVault again.
3. The Face ID prompt should appear automatically.
4. Verify that your vault unlocks after successful Face ID authentication.

### Step 4: Verify Master Password Fallback

1. Lock PanicVault.
2. When the Face ID prompt appears, cancel it or deliberately fail authentication (by covering the TrueDepth camera).
3. Verify that you can enter your master password manually to unlock the vault.
4. This confirms that your master password remains functional as a fallback.

## Setting Up PanicVault with Touch ID (Mac)

PanicVault supports Touch ID on Mac through the built-in Touch ID sensor on MacBook keyboards and the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID for desktop Macs.

### Step 1: Open Your Vault

1. Open PanicVault on your Mac.
2. Open or create your database, entering your master password.

### Step 2: Enable Touch ID Unlock

1. Open PanicVault's preferences or settings.
2. Locate the "Touch ID" or "Biometric Unlock" setting.
3. Enable it.
4. You may be prompted to authenticate with Touch ID to confirm. Place your finger on the Touch ID sensor.
5. PanicVault stores the vault decryption key in the Mac's Secure Enclave, protected by Touch ID.

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Lock PanicVault (or quit and reopen the app).
2. When prompted to unlock, place your finger on the Touch ID sensor.
3. Verify that your vault unlocks successfully.

### Step 4: Verify Master Password Fallback

1. Restart your Mac (this clears biometric authorization and requires the password).
2. Open PanicVault.
3. Verify that the master password prompt appears (Touch ID is unavailable immediately after restart until you log in with your Mac password).
4. Enter your master password to confirm it works.

## Configuring Auto-Lock Settings

With biometric unlock enabled, you can use more aggressive auto-lock settings without sacrificing usability. The vault locks quickly, and unlocking it takes less than a second with Face ID or Touch ID.

### Recommended Settings

- **Auto-lock timeout**: 1-5 minutes of inactivity. With biometric unlock, a short timeout adds meaningful security (the vault is encrypted in memory when locked) with minimal inconvenience.
- **Lock on app switch**: Enable if available. This locks the vault whenever you switch away from the password manager app. With biometric unlock, re-entering the app triggers a quick Face ID or Touch ID check.
- **Lock on device lock**: Enable. When your device's screen locks, your vault should lock too. Biometric unlock makes this seamless -- unlocking your device and then unlocking your vault happens in a natural sequence.

### Settings to Avoid

- **Extended timeouts (30+ minutes)**: Long auto-lock timeouts leave your decrypted credentials in memory for prolonged periods. If you step away from your device, your vault contents are accessible to anyone who picks it up during the timeout window.
- **No auto-lock**: Disabling auto-lock defeats the purpose of vault encryption during active use. With biometric unlock available, there is no reason to leave your vault perpetually unlocked.

## Setting Up Other Password Managers

While specific steps vary by app, the general process for enabling biometric unlock is similar across password managers:

### 1Password

1. Open 1Password and unlock with your master password.
2. Go to Settings > Security.
3. Enable Face ID (iPhone/iPad) or Touch ID (Mac).
4. 1Password supports the same Secure Enclave-based key storage used by PanicVault.

### Bitwarden

1. Open Bitwarden and unlock with your master password.
2. Go to Settings > Account Security.
3. Enable "Unlock with Biometrics."
4. Bitwarden supports both Face ID and Touch ID on [Apple devices](/apple/).

### KeePassXC (Mac)

1. Open KeePassXC and unlock your database.
2. Go to KeePassXC > Preferences > Security (or Settings > Security).
3. Enable "Unlock databases with Touch ID."
4. Note: KeePassXC supports Touch ID on Mac but does not have an iOS app. For KeePass on iPhone/iPad, PanicVault or Strongbox are the primary options.

### Apple Passwords

Apple's built-in Passwords app uses biometric authentication by default -- no additional setup is required. Opening the Passwords app triggers Face ID or Touch ID automatically.

## Understanding Biometric Timeout Behavior

It is important to understand when your device will require a password instead of allowing biometric unlock, as this affects your vault access.

### When iOS Requires Passcode (Not Biometrics)

- After device restart or power-on
- After 48 hours since the device was last unlocked
- After 5 failed biometric authentication attempts
- After a remote lock command from Find My
- During Emergency SOS (triggered by pressing the side button 5 times)
- When the device has not been unlocked via passcode in the last 156 hours (6.5 days) and biometrics have not been used in the last 4 hours

### When macOS Requires Password (Not Touch ID)

- After system restart
- After waking from hibernation (not regular sleep)
- After 48 hours since last unlock
- After 5 failed Touch ID attempts
- When the FileVault-protected disk needs to be unlocked (at boot)

### What This Means for Your Vault

When your device falls back to requiring a passcode or password, your password manager will also require the master password. This is expected behavior, not a failure. It ensures that:

1. Your master password remains in your memory (you type it occasionally).
2. A device restart clears all biometric authorizations, forcing re-authentication.
3. Extended inactivity triggers full re-authentication.

## Security Best Practices After Setup

### Practice Your Master Password

Once biometric unlock is working, you will type your master password infrequently. This creates a risk of forgetting it. To prevent this:

- Type your master password at least once per week. Deliberately lock your vault and unlock it with the password, not biometrics.
- Consider setting a weekly calendar reminder to practice your master password.
- Store your master password in a physically secure backup location for emergency recovery.

### Review Your Biometric Enrollment Periodically

- On iPhone: Settings > Face ID & Passcode shows your current Face ID enrollment.
- On Mac: System Settings > Touch ID & Password shows enrolled fingerprints.
- Ensure only your biometrics are enrolled. Remove any fingerprints or face enrollments you do not recognize. Each enrolled biometric has access to every app that uses biometric authentication on that device, including your [password vault](/biometrics/biometric-vault-protection/).

### Keep Software Updated

Face ID and Touch ID security improvements are delivered through iOS and macOS updates. Running the latest version ensures:

- Current anti-spoofing neural network models for [Face ID](/biometrics/how-face-id-works/)
- Current liveness detection algorithms for [Touch ID](/biometrics/fingerprint-sensors/)
- Secure Enclave firmware updates
- Security patches for the LocalAuthentication framework

### Know Your Emergency Procedures

Memorize the procedure to quickly disable biometric unlock:

- **iPhone**: Press the side button 5 times rapidly. This triggers Emergency SOS and requires the passcode for the next unlock.
- **Mac**: Press and hold the power button to force restart, or simply restart normally. Touch ID is disabled until the Mac login password is entered.

This is your safety valve for situations where you are concerned about [compelled biometric access](/biometrics/legal-implications/).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Face ID Not Working After Setup

- Ensure nothing is covering the TrueDepth camera (screen protectors, cases, or dirt).
- Check that Face ID is still enrolled: Settings > Face ID & Passcode.
- Try resetting Face ID and re-enrolling: Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Reset Face ID, then set up again.
- After re-enrollment, you will need to re-enable biometric unlock in PanicVault.

### Touch ID Not Recognizing Fingerprint

- Clean the Touch ID sensor and your finger.
- Ensure your finger is dry (not wet or sweaty).
- Try re-scanning the finger: go to the Touch ID settings and delete the problematic fingerprint, then re-enroll it.
- After re-enrollment, re-enable biometric unlock in PanicVault.

### Vault Requiring Master Password Unexpectedly

If your vault requires the master password when you expected biometric unlock:

- Check if your device was recently restarted (biometric unlock is disabled after restart).
- Check if biometric enrollment changed (adding or removing a fingerprint invalidates stored keys).
- Check the auto-lock timeout settings in your password manager.
- If the issue persists, disable and re-enable biometric unlock in the password manager settings.

### "Biometric Unlock Not Available" Error

This typically means the device's biometric hardware is not enrolled or has been disabled:

- Verify Face ID or Touch ID is set up in device settings.
- Ensure the password manager has permission to use biometrics (Settings > [App Name] on iOS).
- Restart the app and try again.

Setting up biometric unlock correctly takes a few minutes but pays dividends every day. With Face ID or Touch ID protecting your vault access, you can use the [strongest possible master password](/biometrics/convenience-vs-security/) without it becoming a burden. Your vault is more secure, your access is faster, and the combination of strong encryption with hardware-backed biometric verification represents the best available approach to [password security](/password-security/) on Apple devices.
